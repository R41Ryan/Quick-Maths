# Quick-Maths
It is a simple desktop console application that tests your arithmetic skills. It works by providing a series of random questions in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
You can modify the difficulty of these questions by changing the range of the operands and the number of questions answer.
Once the series of questions have been answered, you can see your score summarized at the end.

# Installation
